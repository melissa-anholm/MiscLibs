Calibrated (Friend) ntuples live here: 
/home/trinat/anholm/Friends

Code to produce position calibrations lives here:
/home/trinat/anholm/ReTuple

mini_cal_maker.cpp      <-- the library that does the fancy stuff for position calibrations.
TheCalibrationator.cpp  <-- uses mini_cal_maker.cpp to produce TTrees with branches for calibrated position info.
ReTuple.cpp             <-- Creates calibrated imcp position info and a few other branches as well.
TestTuple.cpp           <-- Demonstrates how to load up a "Friend" with the original ntuples.
